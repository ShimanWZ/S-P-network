# S-P-network

this project is a class assignment for the network security course
in this project, we make a simple S-P network and test the avalanche property with different inputs
1. the input is given in the class
2. n random inputs generated by the rand function and the mean value returned

the substitution and permutation function can change to generate different S-P networks
the functions used in this project are based on a class example
